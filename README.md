# Overview

**Recordo** is a **JUnit** extension that simplifies common testing tasks, streamlining the process of creating fast, deterministic, and accurate tests. 
It consists of 4 modules, each serving a specific purpose in the testing lifecycle.

* **Recordo Read Module** automates loading test resources from JSON files.


* **Recordo Assertions Module** provides assertions to verify that the actual object matches the expected one stored in a JSON file. It also supports CSV string assertions.


* **Recordo MockMvc Module** integrates with the Spring MVC Test framework to facilitate testing of Spring MVC applications.


* **Recordo MockServer Module** records real REST interactions during the first test run, which are then used for mocking in subsequent runs.
